# Before starting 

### This project is based on **FoodSeg103**[1] dataset. You can follow the repository link below to get more information about the dataset. from [here](https://github.com/LARC-CMU-SMU/FoodSeg103-Benchmark-v1)
-----------------------
### That project is based on **Ultralytics YOLOv8**[2]. You can follow the repository link below to get more information about the **Ultralytics YOLOv8**. from [here](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
-----------------------

### In this project, I used the following :

- Python 3.11.4
- ultralytics
- torch: nightly CUDA 12.1
- opencv-python
- numpy

### To install virtualenv you need to run the following command in the terminal

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

### To create a virtual environment you need to run the following command in the terminal

```bash
virtualenv venv
```

### To activate a virtual environment you need to run the following command in the terminal

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### To deactivate a virtual environment you need to run the following command in the terminal

```bash
deactivate
```

### To install requirements.txt you need to run the following command in the terminal

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Before starting the project, you need to download and extract dataset from `dataset.rar` file
